        The issue might already be fixed in a development release or main. This is not required, but helps us greatly.
        To install the latest development release clone dev brach and try again.
        Run `npm list music-engines` and use the last part of the printed information (`d23280c` for `music-engines@xx.x.x-dev.1530234593.d23280c`)
