# Seeking support?

I only use this issue tracker for bug reports and feature request. I won't be able to provide general support or answer questions in the form of GitHub issues.

For general questions about discord.js installation and use please use the dedicated support channels in my Discord server: https://discord.gg/7jgfP6j4Tc

Any issues that don't directly involve a bug or a feature request will likely be closed and redirected.
